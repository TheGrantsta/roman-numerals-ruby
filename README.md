# Roman Numerals
Given an integer input, produce output in Roman Numeral format.

There are just 7 Roman numerals: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Unlike most other number systems, the numerals can only be used in particular sequences.

Another rule is that apart from M, you can only have a maximum of 3 of any given numeral in a row.

Here is a quick overview of the 7 Roman numerals and what each is worth.
